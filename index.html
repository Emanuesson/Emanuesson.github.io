				    <h3>Description</h3>
				    <p>Working in a scientific environment requires a fast, open and simple approach in software-design that is flexible enough to get extended to a full scale project in the end. The gtk+ library offers many of these features in terms of UI-programming and the underlying GLib and Gobject-framework is a powerful approach to use object-oriented programming (OOP) mostly independent of the available platform or programming language. Despite the advantages, most free scientific codes do not apply Gtk+ even in applications were the integration would be highly preferable. Gdv tries to provide a part of the functionality to make Gtk+ a little more interesting for people that are looking for a way to observe and control technical environments.</p>

				    <p>I startet to work on gdv because I was pretty annoyed by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2629099/gtk-based-graph/2631361#2631361">the options that are available for the visualisation of scientific and technical data</a>, such as forcing <a href="https://github.com/joastbg/gtk-socket-gnuplot">Gnuplot</a> within a GtkWidget-instance (this approach limited to systems with a working X11-platform), or using really old libraries such as <a href="http://gtkextra.sourceforge.net/cms/">GtkExtra</a> that are now so outdated that they require functions <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gtk-devel-list/2017-April/msg00007.html">deprecated 17 years ago</a>, or a rather specialized library such as <a href="https://github.com/GNOME/goffice">GOffice</a> that reimplements a lot of the overhead that has been removed or improved in Gtk+ over the years, leading to rather akward solutions for things one would expect as elementary functionality of any graphic library based on Gtk+, such as theming or geometry-handling.</p>

				    <h3>Current functionality</h3>

				    <p>For now the functions provided by Gdv are still really limited. However a good starting point for applications is provided by the documentation</p>

            <p>Epsara the <strong>e</strong>nhanced <strong>p</strong>article <strong>s</strong>cattering and <strong>r</strong>eaction <strong>a</strong>nalysis framework is a library that is designed to assist the calculation of particle scattering spectra over energy for the aim of ion beam analysis. A physical technique of elemenetal detection that has several applications ranging from fundamental solid state physics, geology, forensics to cultural heritage.</p>

            <p>Epsara is designed on the basis of the gobject infrastructure. I mainly wrote it, because I was frustrated by the shortcoming of existing ion beam analysis codes and the so called <a href="http://home.mpcdf.mpg.de/~mam/NIM%20B268-1824.pdf">IDF (ion beam analysis data format)</a>. However there are some points that have to be clarified concerning the copyrights of existing modells and algorithms for energy loss of particles in matter. Mainly the TRIM-table from Ziegler, Biersack, Littmark. Therefor I can just provide a shortened version without the exact tables and algorithms on the web.</p>

            <p>If you have any wishes or questions it might be better and faster to simply contact me.</p>

            <p>Gevse is a Gnome-based EVSE-system (electric vehicle charging station). It was influenced by similar projects, such as the <a href="https://github.com/SmartEVSE/smartevse">SmartEVSE</a>. The general aim is the load management and the logging of power consumption for different vehicle charging stations on a single raspberry pi. A lot of the planned functionality is still missing. For the moment it's actual nothing more than a nice little electricity meter with an underlying sqlite-database and some functionality for system maintenance based on <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-broadway.html">Gtk+ and broadway</a>.</p>

				    <h3>Data management</h3>

            <p>For the moment data logging is just implemented for a simple S0-interfaces. This should be provided in a more general manner in the future.
            </p>

            <h3>User management</h3>

            <p>Users should apply to the charging process via a phone-call, a user interface, automatically via the license plate or by an human administrator. However this functionality is at the moment still completely missing.
